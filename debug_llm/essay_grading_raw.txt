    "Revise the body content to eliminate repetitions and ensure coherent, flowing paragraphs that directly support the outline.",
    "Enhance critical analysis by incorporating specific examples, evidence, and counterarguments related to female education and obedience.",
    "Improve grammar, vocabulary, and style for better readability; proofread to avoid errors that disrupt the narrative.",
    "Strengthen transitions between sections to improve overall coherence and logical progression.",
    "Develop the conclusion with a stronger restatement of the thesis and a forward-looking statement on the topic's implications."

  "overall_remarks": "The essay has a solid outline demonstrating topic understanding, but severe OCR errors in the body render much of the content incoherent and repetitive, significantly weakening argumentation, depth, and expression. With revisions to clarify and expand ideas, it could achieve a higher score."
