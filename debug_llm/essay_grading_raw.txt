      "rating": "Weak",
      "key_comments": "The outline is present and attempts to structure the essay with an introduction, body sections on risks of multipolarity (e.g., strategic uncertainty, arms race), and a conclusion on promoting peace. However, the interpretation is superficial, with the thesis on dual potential (fueling war but promotable peace) not deeply explored in the garbled text. Clarity is hampered by OCR errors making the outline hard to follow."

      "key_comments": "The introduction attempts to set the stage with a quote from Kissinger and a thesis on multipolarity's risks and peace potential, but it is fragmented due to scanning issues (e.g., repeated phrases, unclear sentences). It lacks a strong hook or clear roadmap."

      "key_comments": "The essay stays somewhat on-topic by discussing multipolarity's impacts (e.g., alliances, economic contestation), but frequent OCR distortions (e.g., garbled words like 'fuelling war' misread) cause digressions and loss of focus. Core arguments on peace vs. war are present but diluted."

    "Develop arguments with specific historical examples, data, or scholarly references to add depth and originality.",

  "overall_remarks": "This essay on multipolarity's potential to promote peace or fuel war shows basic understanding through its outline but is undermined by severe scanning errors, resulting in an incoherent and unpolished submission. While the topic is relevant, the lack of clarity, depth, and proper expression prevents it from achieving a passing standard. A revised, clear version with stronger analysis could significantly improve the score."
