to cap all the factors which are contributing towards water depletion such as water wastage, overconsumption and increasing water pollution. Instrumental steps such as implementation of water conservation techniques and multiplication of water dams - number are needed more than ever to ensure that present and the future generations of all life forms are not deprived of the core resource that sustains their existence. - The proverb, " Do not waste water even if you are standing at a running Stream" is an iconic lesson from the history. Since the ancient times, water has always been considered "sacred" There used to be oldest civilizations that only thrived because of their proximity to the water source. CS CamScanner

We have sacrificed it to an extent that it has increasingly become a finite resource. According to a report by World Health Organization (WHO), 1/3rd of the world's consumable water has been lost to human follies. The present condition of scarcity across the hel water globe makes the ages old proverb: do not waste water even if you are Standing at a running stream? much timely and relevant. It helps in individuals' recalling of the reality that water must be conserved in and under all circumstances in order to maintain all life forms on this planet.

Hence, water has always been and always will be significant from the social, political and. economic as well as environmental point of view. - The proverb encapsulates it all and provides humans with the T water as a finite resources that must be ulitized perspective to think about intelligently. There are many factors which makes water a finite source despite how abundant it seems. The first and foremost is the "climate change" which has led to the meeting of glaciers which CS CamScanner
are primary source of fresh water for the living beings. Countries lying on the equator belt are drastically being affected the most. One of the stark examples is that of Pakistan which has lost 1/3rd of its glacial resource since 1960s - 2025. Similarly, many other countries are facing the some consequences, making climate change, an essential factor contributing to water depletion Similarly, over consumption of the surface water is also one of the prime factors which are contributing towards loss of water. This is mostly done to meet domestic, agricultural and industrial demands. It is leading towards lack of water as most of the water is being wasted and irresponsibly used after extraction. This is also CS CamScanner

Hence, over- consumption proves to be a consistent factor in making water a finite resources. In the same manner, abysmal condition of water wastage is a stark contributing factor in water Scarcity. The statistics across the globe prove that water is not being used deligently by the masses. An example in this Case is that of Pakistan where 60% of the consumable fresh water goes to waste. annually. The added disadvantage is that it is agriculture that makes 80% of this water wastage. This primarily owing to the traditional methods of agriculture such as flood irrigation". This CS CamScanner
condition of water wastage - is not just endangering humans but also the other living organisms which are being deprived of vital component of existence owing to human follies. Like wise, increasing water pollution is also one of the important and key contributor. Water pollution is mainly being done by Organic particulate matter (OBM) as well as the industrial chemical based wastes such as compounds of Sulphur, nitrogen as well as phosphates. These pollutants on entering the water bodies pollute the water and make it unconsumable.

Another factur in line is the lack in the number of water Storage reservoirs. It is a pressing issue of the developing countries that they lack the means to develop water reservoirs which result in wastage of water. An example here is that of Pakistan. where there are only 13 major dams having only 13.7 MAF live Storage, which is far less as compared to the needed SOMAF according to an estimate. This lack of the storage capacity impacts every thing - from daily lives; to industrial; to agricultural outcomes. Hence it pases to be a huge cause for keeping the Status of water as a CS CamScanner

People usually take water as a forgranted resource - that they believe would - never extinguish. This is a completely false belief which realizes into the " tragedy of the common" pertaining to water. This Concept explains how water being a resource of common use by all is being irrespon- sibly utilized and no single individual take its responsib- - - ility on himself and expecting others to take care. This may results in over consumption, wastage and exhaustion of water. Hence it is an important factor making water a finite resources for all. CS CamScanner

It is the abandonment of all traditional, water draining techniques that are widely used in agriculture sector across the world, especially in the global south. It is important to adopt the water efficient "Crop per Drop" techniques that ensures most agricultural activities under least consumption of water. It includes techniques such as "drip irrigation as wellas. water sprinkler. This can efficiently, infact drastically pull down the ascending statistics of water wastes pertaining to agriculture. Another important suggestion is pertaining to the industrial sector. which results in water wastage as well as water pollution. It must be made mandatory to CS CamScanner

Moreover there should also be a mechanization for check as well penalization of the violators. Last but not least, - there must be arrangement, both financial as well as adminis- trative, to build more dams, especially in the countries like Pakistan where infrastructure available is insufficient. Similarly this leads to wards loss of much of the water that drains from glaciers to the ocean, be coming impotable and unusable.

Similarly, the practice of Krainwater harvest" con also prove to be beneficial as it is absolutely safe for domest, agricultural and industrial use as well.
