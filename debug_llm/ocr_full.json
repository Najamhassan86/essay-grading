JTL ITI JFD 1 It has, undeniably, wisely phrased that it needs education to break free females from blind obedience. Any one who is educated, - questions, thinks, rationalizes and only then make an action. Any task they perform is backed by national calculation and - estimation of the consequences of following - that command Same is the case with - Women. When female are educated, they - do not act blindly or follow mindlessly. - They question and rationalize and - only than decide on whether to comply or not. By enlarging the femal mind is by virtue of educating them makes them better not only for their own good but also for the entire society. Unfortunately, there are various social, economic, political and traditional hindrances in way of educating the females. They make more than 50% of the world population yet their plight gets crushed intiname of traditions and cultures- Owing to reasons, females become bound to obey blindly. They suffer socially, politically and economically and generational cycles of women

There are many rational and pragmatic ways through which the hindrances in educating females can be eliminated and their cause for no more blind obedience can take up momentum. There are many ways to prove that when female mind is enlarged by education, the blind obedience ends. Firstly, it is to be acknowledged that only educated females can break free from the shackles of patriarchal mindset that exists on the very principle of blind obedience. This mind set decides what women cando, or can not; what women can wear or wear not; what women can feel or feel not. It also confuses and chains on the complexities of gender- women ed roles and nurturing roles as daughters, mothers, wives and sisters. They do not let women think once for her own self and

But when a female is educated, she does not comply blindly and learns to think and care for herself too in the same way. Secondly, when female gets - - - education, she secures economic sustenance for herself. In this way she does not depend on any one economically and can make impartial, out of free will decision for the future. This protects her from blindly following someone just because they materially provide for them According to UNFD (United Nations Population Fund) there is only 28% female labour force which means the other 72% women are economi- cally dependent on their male guardian. Hence, when the female is educated, she comes out of this vicious cycle of dependence and makes decisions for herself just as she likes. Thirdly, Females when edu- cated, are fully aware of their rights. In Pakistan, an educated female would know her constitutional
rights. She would legal facilitations to protect them such as Protection of Women Against Workplace Harassment, (2010), Acid Control and Acid Crime Prevention Act (2011) and Women Property Protection Right (2020). And uneducated female can not be expected of knowing these rights but on educated female in Pakistan would know and she would not stand any unjustice against her personhood. Fourthly, educated females become immune to evil social customs and the absurd stereotypes. She starts to think and live bey and them. She starts to believe that customs are only here to margin- alize cher and she, in result, does not give any importance or signifonce to them in order to prove that they are above these things and their energies only need to be utilized in achieving their higher goals of life only.

Unfortunately, according to United Nations report women make 230% of world parliaments. Yet, there are women, although handful, that participate in the political process and become part of the decision making bodies and make laws and plass amendment to protect women and accelerated their education journey so they do not have to blindly comply to anybody and themselves uplift themselves. S Despite the need and significance of female education, there are some mounting impediments that paralyze the process of women education. Firstly, there are societal barriers and menace of povertythat hinders worven education. Unfortunately there is a culture of "boy's educa- tion over girl's be cause he
will be the provider of the household" This is an absolutely unjustifiable reason to keep females illiterate. It is the women who nurture and polishes the next generation. If she herself is not educated, how will sche will ensure good brought up of her Children. As Napoleon Bonaparte has said "give me educated mothers and I will give your. excellent nation". Hence, this remains an obstacle. Secondly, females are totally reliant on their patriarchs to provide them with education. Unfortunately education is not free and requires resources to sponsers it. Even those women who work, earn very meagerly. According to World Bank report, 38% of women across the globe earn less than $ 1.9/day This figure is way below the current $4.0 poverty line. Here it is a big hurdle and women become unable to support their or their daughters' education in such low means and eventually

This is a very common practice in South Asian region. In Pakistan 18% of the girls of the age 13-17 are married very young and become "Child brides". This is a great social customs that destroys, a female, socially, sexually and health wise Here, it is a big obst acl which needs to be eradicated at all costs for the safety of women and their progress. Fourthly, there is also lack of government provisions to enable female education. Owing to which there are 132 million Out of School girls worldwide. In Pakistan, there 14 million girls out of 26 million total OOSC. The government does not provide for the sanitation
needs as well as safe and secure transportation for females 1 from education institutions to their homes, which makes parents reluctant to support girls education Fifthly, there is massive digital divide to which the greatest affectees are women. Globally the digital divide is 60% out of which girls/females are 51% In Pakistan, situation is even worse. The to digital divide is 58% whereas for girls it is 24% This shows that more than half of the girls population in Pakistan does not even have access turainternet HA which shuts the door of online learning world on them completely.

There is a need to understand that women, if let like this, will only burdenize the world and the potential will go vain. As Hillary Clinton said, "women are the target untapped resource of the world"." This absolutely true in its essence. Here, for Women there is need of "attitudinal Change", not more legislations void of enforcements.

Education is universal today and accessible online for free. Governments must take actions to curb this divide. In Pakistan, there are NGOS like "Teletaleem" which is working for the provision of education in for flung areas. Government must launch such initiatives as well as build the public-private partnership in order to streamline the process Fifthly, there is dire need to enforce the protection laws and International goals that ensure woman protection and education. The United Nations- Sustainable Development Goals (SDGS) for 2030 preses on the issue of female education. In SDC: 4 there is goal to ensure free education and education rights for all genders without any discrimination . similarly in Pakistan, there are constitutional safeguards that protect woman
= Secondly, there is need to - make efforts for women education and skill development. Unfortunately Women make up 57% of NEET (Not in Employment, Education or training). Hence it is not just enough to educate them but also equip them with the right skills (so that they can earn from it and secure their economic independence. Thirdly, there is need to have a universal consensus on minimum 1years for marriage of girls. This would not only arest many physical, seval, and health issues from the lives of women but would also buy them time to complete their education and then gain economic independence and only tham sign into marital relation. This protects the women as well as ensure her respect and equality in marital bond as well which is need of the hour.
education. Article 25(A) dolares women deserve equal education rights. Hence, by applying, rather enforcing these laws, much of the edu- cation provision problems for women will alleviate. To conclude, it can be deduced that embellishing the female mind with education will protect her from blind compliance. She will rationalize before she does anything which will not only make her better, but world better. There are grave impediments that stops women education process but there is nothing that can not be changed and with attidumal change and policy implementation educating women can be come much more convenient not just for their own person hood but for the progress of the world. .
