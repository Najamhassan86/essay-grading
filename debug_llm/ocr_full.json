It is aptly quoted by Henry Kissinger in his book World Order", "Multipolar systems are the most prone to war because they contain the greatest potential for miscalculations As the world is transitioning towards multipolarity, the risks of strategic miscalculation and great power contestation have surged Multipolarity, by strengthening strategic uncertainty among great powers, intensifying security dilemma and promoting bloc politics is inadvertently fuelling war From Samuel P. Huntington's "Clash of Civilization" to Henry Kissinger's "World Order" and Fareed Zakaria's "Ten Lessons for the Post- Pandemic World" all converge to say that multipolarity fuels way by intensifying ideological confrontation restoring competitive great-power politics and weakening global institutions. Along with this as the world transitions towards multipolarity the threat of bloc politics, return of hard power and global supply chain disruption have become inevitable. Likewise multipolarity is also fuelling financial pluralism challenging the hegemony of western-led global financial 1 institutions and promoting economic Scanned with CS CamScanner
security dilemma. i Nevertheless, strategic measures can be adopted to promote peace in the volatile world milieu. Thereby only through shared global competition, empowering global institutions and prioritizing soft power, the world can maintain peaceful coexistence. Before charting the path forward it is imperative to understand multipolarity samuel P. Huntington in his various essays on global order defines multipolarity ras "Multipolarity is a distribution of "power in which several major states or bloss possess comparable capabilities, preventing any single power from dominating the international system" This highlights that multipolarity drags nations in a zero. sum game. Since the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 and the end of Cold War (1947- 1991) the United States remained the unmatchable hegemon of the world. However, with the emergence of China in 2008 and its accelerated growth in military economics and Scanned with CS CamScanner

Russia as a counterweight to the established unipolar hegemony of the us have fuelled strategy uncertainty This uncertainty has locked them in a zero-cum game, escalating the risks of full-scale war. Multipolarity sharpens the security dilemma and fuels arms race. The military buildup of one state creates a security dilemma in other states which contributes to an arms race. This culminates into regional instability which ultimately spirals into global instability. The Indo-Pacific remains one of the most militarized and volatile region of the world. The growing military and maritime competition of China and the US in the Indo-Pacific has escalated the risks of a full- fledged war. Slightest miscalculations can potentially lead to a full- scale war. Henceforth it can be argued that multipolarity exhibits the potential of morphing small-scale confrontation into a large-scale war which can lead to regional and global instability.

technology, the unipolar hegemony of the United States is fracturing. Meanwhile, the emergence of Russia and its anti-western doctrine have instigated the return of hard power, escalating the risks of miscalculations and mistrust. Hence, the world once governed by America is now unfolding in a new phase, marked by multipolarity Having highlighted the term multipolarity, it is now crucial to underline the potential faultlines that can fuel war. due to multipolarity One of the most significant features of multipolarity is that it strengthens strategic uncertainty among great powers. As the world transitions toward multipolarity, the rise of great powers a Thucydides Trap to already established powers. This accelerates geopolitical contestation among great powers. As Ronald Reagan notes in his book "An American Life" "Multipolarity intensifies the Thucydides Trap because several rising powers challenge several established ones simultaneously:" The emergence of China and the resurgence of 1 - Scanned with CamScanner"
Multipolarity promotes alliances and counter- alliances and instigates bloc politics. As witnessed in the pre-WWI and pre-www era, the emergence of alliances and counter-alliances dragged the world into the most devastating world wars. The alliances system of Otto von Bismarck sowed the seeds of the World War II. Likewise, in the contemporary transitional phase of the world, the emergence of the US and Chinese- led blocs resisting on economic, security and ideological quarantees have cartographed multipolarity as a tool of fuelling economic and ideological war. Therefore, it can be stated that multipolarity by cartographing alliances and counter- alliances fuels war. Multipolarity undermines consensus- building thereby fuelling institutional paralysis. As multipolarity promotes minilateralism, the emergence of new regional and minilateral institutionals such as BRICS SCO etc. has been challenging the credibility of western-led global institutions Scanned with CamScanner

This is evident from the proxy conflicts in the Middle East.

This highlights that how a multipolar world opens channels of covert and intelligence. led operations. Such operations contribute to regional instability and can also drag great powers , thereby igniting a way that will not only have regional repercussions but also global consequences. Due to the rise of the middle powers, a wave of Scanned with CS CamScanner"
This undermines consensus-building in global institution. The monopoly of great veto powers in the United Nations has significantly lowered its integrity and credibility. The paralysis of the UNSC over Syria, Yemen and Palestine has exposed the strategic loopholes of this global institution. Hence, multipolarity is contributing to the emergence of minilateral and regional institutions Multipolarity exacerbates the return of hard power. Great powers showcase their military and technological might by waging wars on vulnerable states to create deterrence in the multipolar world. The Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 marks the return of hard power. Russia has initiated to invade eastern European territories to expand its sphere of influence and reassert its dominance in the world. This encourages other states to use similar tactics to emerge as recognizable powers.

nationalist militarism emerges as such states contect for regional autonomy With the rise of middle powers such as India, Brazil, Turkey, South Africa and Saudi Arabia the world order has become more complex. These nations Leverage their geostrategic locations and natural resource reserves to exert great influence in multilateral and minilateral institutions. To quote Raja C. Mohan, "Middle powers survive by leveraging their geostrategic locations: These powers are now focusing on their rearmament and technological advancements to enhance their bargaining power. Therefore, multipolarity is fuelling nationalism as it did. in pre-WWII erg. Multipolarity escalates economic contestation thereby disrupting global supply chains. As the great powers prioritize national interests over global, they tend to instigate economic warfare.

Huntington. "The most destructive conflicte in history grose from ideological confrontations." This demonstrates that the emergence of authoritarianism as a counterweight to liberalism has potentially intensified ideological competitive Liberalism led by the United States and authorianism propagated by China has initiated fragmentation and bifurcation of the world into two blues. These states use genstrategic and geoeconomic tools to expand their ideological sphere of Influence.

potential Having underscored the fault lines of multipolarity fuelling war now the task there les to chart a path forward that can ensure shared good. Firstly it is crucial to strengthen and empower international institutions to mediate conflict. In this regard the United Nations can play a crucial role. The United Nations must serve as a neutral arena for dialogue, mediation and peacekeeping To quote Henry Cobat, "The primary the fundamental,the essential purpose of the United Nations is to promote peace." United Nations an institution that emerged after the WWII in 1945 was established to prevent the possibility of the future wars Therefore, it is essential to eliminate the monopoly of P5 and empower UN as a neutral global institute Secondly promoting preventive diplomar is crucial to resolve conflicts before they cascade into full-scale war Preventive diplomacy uses early- warning systems shuttle diplomacy mediation and confidence-building I Scanned with CamScanner
measures CBMs to pacify tensions before they escalate into widespread conflicts. Strong diplomatic engagement through Track I and Track IL diplomacy reduce misperceptions and keep nations at talking terms even during tense periods In 2015, the US and Iran paved the way for the JCPOA by institutionalizing backcharmel diplomacy in Oman. his helped both nations to address their concerns on Iran's potential nuclear buildup and de-escalated war-like situation. This illustrates how preventive diplomacy can pave a way towards peaceful negotiations averting the risks of war . Thirdly prioritizing soft Dower engagement to reduce hostility among rival powers Soft power remains the cornerstore of peaceful coexistence As quoted by Joseph Nye in his seminal work "Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics " In a world of multiple powers soft power becomes more important than coercion" Soft power encompassing cultural Scanned with CS CamScanner
educational and technological exchanger builds trust among nations and decreases zero-sum thinking. When people to people ties remain open and stakes are shared, it becomes difficult for governments to mobilize mass support for war. The Ping Pong Diplomacy (1971) between the US and China softened the relations and reduced Cold War hostility ultimately leading to normalization of diplomatic ties. Henceforth, by undertaking sovereignty and national interests of states, peaceful multipolar world can sustain: Next, managing great Power competition through controlled rivalry and crisis management protocols. As the US. China and US-Russia rivalries intensify the risks of miscalculation grow. Establishing crisis hotlines military- to-military communication, state- level diplomatic dialogues and rules-based negotiations can contain great power friction and Prevent escalation.

confrontations in South China Sea from spiralling into major power conflict By institutionalizing dialogue between the great powers and highlighting the results of rivalry tensions can be de-escalated and the threats of zero-sum rivalry can be prevented in the multipolar world. Lastly reducing nuclear risks through updated treaties, no-frist use pledges and de- escalation mechanisms. Nuclear weapons remain the greatest existential threats. As the great powers and middle powers are contesting to increase their nuclear warheads and achieve nuclear weapons, multipolarity has brought the world to the brink of catastrophic war. Consequently, vodating Cold War arms control treaties, no-first use doctrines increasing transparency in nuclear deployments and modernizing nuclear risk hotlines can reduce the probability of nuclear. triggered world war.

not remains a distant dream. By institutionalizing global cooperation through unbiased global institutions, adopting preventing diplomacy and prioritizing soft power engagement, the world can peacefully transition toward multipolarity. As Ronald Reagan remarked, "Peace is not the absence of conflicts, but the ability to handle conflicts by peaceful means." 7 1 Scanned with CS CamScanner

This shows how arms control can effectively reduce the risks of nuclear war in a multipolar world In a nutshell, multipolarin has strengthened strategic uncertainty among great powers which holds the potential to fuel war. Furthermore, by intensifying security dilemma, multipolarty has intensified arms race contributing to regional and global instability. Likewise, the emergence of geopolitical geoeconomic and financial blocs ha's set the stage for a war fuelled by multipolarity.

Along with this, multipolarity has mandated the return of hard power as states use hard measures to expand their sphere of influence.
