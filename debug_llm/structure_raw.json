  "overall_flow_comment": "The essay is well-structured, beginning with a clear outline on pages 1-4 that logically divides the topic into introduction, benefits of education, impediments, and measures. The main body from page 5 follows this outline sequentially, providing detailed arguments and examples for each section. The flow is coherent, with smooth transitions between ideas, building from problem identification to solutions, culminating in a reinforcing conclusion on page 16. The structure ensures comprehensive coverage without redundancy."
